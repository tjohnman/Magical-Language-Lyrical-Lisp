Vita: "Sharkjima, who was protecting Arisa and the others, left them in Kyoto and went to Osaka, right? @/
  What would have happened if there were other agents heading to Kyoto at that time?"\
  gosub *komiyan_rein
Rein: "Apparently, he can sense presences within a 200 km radius. @/
If he's in Kyoto, then at least the entire Kinki region is within range."\
  gosub *komiyan_vita
Vita: "So, he knew there was only one pursuer and that's why he counterattacked?"\
  gosub *komiyan_zafila
Zafira: "That's not all. It was based on the assumption that he could defeat the opponent alone. It's an impressive ability to assess combat strength."\
  gosub *komiyan_vita
Vita: "He's quite the asset that the Bureau would want."\
  gosub *komiyan_rein
Rein: "But did he have to confront them directly? If our location wasn't known, I think he should have ambushed them to reduce our harm..."\
  gosub *komiyan_vita
Vita: "Because it goes against the spirit of chivalry."\
  gosub *komiyan_rein
Rein: "But he's a butler..."\
  gosub *komiyan_vita
Vita: "Then it's the spirit of a butler."\
  gosub *komiyan_rein
Rein: "What's the spirit of a butler?"\
  gosub *komiyan_zafila
Zafira: "However, this counterattack might have been a failure."\
  gosub *komiyan_rein
Rein: "Huh? Why is that? We repelled them properly."\
  gosub *komiyan_zafila
Zafira: "That's why. The Bureau got serious and even sent in Nanoha."\
  gosub *komiyan_vita
Vita: "But if we keep running and don't get caught, wouldn't that make them serious too? @/
  In the end, isn't it the same thing?"\
  gosub *komiyan_zafila
Zafira: "However, it would buy time. Not being able to contact Nanoha early must mean they joined the capture operation early."\
  gosub *komiyan_rein
Rein: "I see. That way, we might have been able to contact Nanoha-san before the Bureau."\
  gosub *komiyan_vita
Vita: "And then have Nanoha cover it up for us?"\
  gosub *komiyan_zafila
Zafira: "Even so, sending only one agent, even if dealing with only one old man, seems... @/
Has the Time-Space Administration Bureau hit rock bottom?"\
  gosub *komiyan_vita
Vita: "But they equip them with powerful devices. @/
It's not like they have no intention of doing anything."\
  gosub *komiyan_zafila
Zafira: "They do strange things. If they really want to capture him, they should send more personnel. @/
Allocating manpower for the search is fundamental. If they don't intend to capture, there's no point in using powerful devices."\
  gosub *komiyan_vita
Vita: "That device didn't seem to help. @/
Well, if they don't intend to capture, there's no need to send anyone in the first place, right?"\
  gosub *komiyan_rein
Rein: "Well, since they're using something like a LISP machine, there must be something beyond our understanding."\
  gosub *komiyan_zafila
Zafira: "So, they're a step above ordinary people."\
